This project is a simple social network app with a single-page React UI designed to test a concept for distributing social media data across different entities securely. It utilizes the **Diffie-Hellman** key exchange protocol to relay information across two distinct serversâ€”one storing metadata and the other holding actual user data. The app explores the feasibility of decentralized data distribution and secure communication between servers, ensuring privacy and separation of concerns in social media applications.
